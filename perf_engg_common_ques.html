Following are some of the key points that you should be prepared to answer if you are projecting yourself as a performance engineer.

1. Explain the product architecture

2. Explain any performance bottlenecks you identified in your product.

   E.g. a) Microservice creating http client connections in multiple threads, was doing Client.create() over and over, causing lot of memory allocation overhead. Client.create() is a thread safe API and can be created in a Factory class.

        b) Data loader microservice ingesting data to the DB was ingesting data to redundant tables, thereby slowing down the entire data ingestion, increasing latency and decreasing throughput.

3. Explain any performance improvements you recommended.

4. Explain some of the performance issues reported by your customer and how you approached the triage.

5. How do you start planning for a performance / system test.

6. Explain any project or tool your developed and you are proud of.
